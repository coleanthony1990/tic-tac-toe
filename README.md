## Introduction

This game of tic tac toe represents two of my ([Cole Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-edwin-anthony/)) favorite things, Cycling & Pineapple.

## Playing Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is played with 2 players. Each one tries to connect their token to two others in a straight line horizontally, diagonally, or vertical to win the game. Their wins are logged and displayed. The winner of each game is displayed in the top of the page. Players alternate the first move each game. Players can also draw if neither are capable of matching 3 of their tokens in a straight line. The game resets when eith a player wins or a draw happens. Neither players win increases if a draw happens. Players alternate the first move each game.

## Future Additions
I would like to add a button to clear scores as well as adding the ability to save to local storage. 
It would also be fun to get more creative with the css.
## Reflections
I found that getting started with the javascript was tough. It was tough to know where to start. Once you just choose somewhere, it makes sense. Seperating the Data model from the dom is still tough but I understand it more with this project. It didn't cause me as much trouble getting the data model to update with the dom for this project. Some functions came fairly easy to me and others were really tough to figure out. It was a little hard to organize where functions were being called. It can get confusing if don't work hard to keep it simple.
